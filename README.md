# Genomic-Prediction-Beans-Kolfaci
This repository contains an R script and input files required to calculate heritability, GEBVs (genomic estimated breeding values), and model fit metrics such as MSE (mean squared error) and correlation, using Bayesian approaches.

1. In the "Genomic Prediction" folder, you will find the script that was iteratively implemented for all variables, using the "Yield" variable as an example.
2. The document is in an R notebook format with the ".Rmd" extension, and it includes an ".html" visualization. Additionally, for each script, the corresponding R environment (".RData") is available, with all the necessary elements loaded to run the script.
3. There are two R notebooks available: "GP_v3.Rmd" and "GP_v3_saturation.Rmd". The first notebook contains the script for genomic prediction using the "Yield" variable, which was used to generate all the values for heritability, GEBVs (genomic estimated breeding values), and model fit metrics such as MSE (mean squared error) and correlation, using Bayesian approaches. The second notebook is used for genomic prediction on SNP sets ranging from 25 to 10,000 markers with the largest effects.
